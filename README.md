# Massively-parallel-boid-simulation

 Boid simulation utilsing OpenMP and MPI to simulate over many processors on a supercomputer.
 Requires Libraries mentioned above as well as Eigen and modern c++ standard.
 For multiple nodes data outputted acorss many files, datajoiner.py can be used to turn into one file.
 
 Simulation viusalised using custom unity project, not uploaded here.
